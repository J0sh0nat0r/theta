## theta

## a GMod connection statistics page & loading screen

theta was a terribly coded, high school gimme-money project. now it's rebuilt into a web app that works. built using slimphp and webpack, you'll be able to use theta to quickly get detailed connection statistics for your server. don't like the loading screen? just include a simple file within your current loading screen to track players entering your server. it's like it's not even there.
questions? sucks. everything is detailed within the script itself. still can't figure out how to use your mouse and keyboard? i only offer support to clients that purchase theta [here](https://gmodstore.com/scripts/view/2806).
